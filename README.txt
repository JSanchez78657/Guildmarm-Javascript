Guildmarm is a discord bot intended to assist with the play of Monster Hunter World.
Using a database to store information about monsters, quests, and more, Guildmarm has
various commands to give some quality of life to MHW players.

Commands:
!itemsearch Fetches a list of the potential sources for an item, sorting into a descending
list, based on the drop percentage.

!monsterdesc Returns a description of the monster.

!monsterdrops Fetches the list of drops that a monster has, sorting them into two lists.
One list is for Low Rank, the other for High rank. Each list is divided into parts
followed by the list of the sources with the drop percentage for the part. The lists are
sorted in descending order with respect to drop percentage.

!monsterrecc Fetches the monster's resistances and calculates the best damage types to
bring against it.

!monstersearch Fetches a list of quests a particular monster can be found in.

!questinfo Creates a summary of a quest including name, rank, prerequisites, completion
condition, failure condition, monsters in the quest, quest rewards, and potential quest
drops.
